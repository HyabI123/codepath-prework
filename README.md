## App Brainstorming (Step 4):

My favorite applications:
1. Youtube
    - Provides Entertainment
    - Many different types of content

2. Doordash
    - Provides food, grocies, etc.
    - Many different things to get on the app
    - Not just restriced to food like other services

3. Instagram
    - Provides entertainment
    - Being able to message people
    - Make connections and see day-to-day lives of others


An app idea I would like to build is an app where users have a character, and in   order to level their character up, they have to complete tasks they set for themselves. For example, if they need to set a reminder/tasks to do homework and they check it off, it could level up the character in some sort of way. The character within the app can level up, and users should be able to buy cosmetics and items for their character. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
